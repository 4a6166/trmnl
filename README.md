# TRMNL
Host for data sources for TRMNL

[TRMNL](https://usetrmnl.com) is an e-ink dashboard that comes with a variety of pre-made apps, like a calendar that integrates with Google.

It also lets you build your own ([docs](https://docs.usetrmnl.com/go), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ofb-mp_x_gM)).

This repo is dedicated to developing personal apps and exposing them to the TRMNL so they can be displayed.

## Templating
Templating for TRMNL is handed by Shopify's [Liquid library](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/).
